MCBugfixMod
===========

Mod for vanilla MC trying to fix bugs and problems in the regular game.

Original authors:
* Cyoor - code@cyoor.se

* Goals:
  - Aiming at taking bugs from the MC bugtracker and solve them while still keeping it as vanilla as possible.
  - Adding optminizations and fixing other bugs even if they are not in the bugtracker
* Things that might be added:
  - Small features that does not change the vanilla gameplay (like the way of displaying information)
* What will not be added:
  - Things that change the gameplay in any way, like for example new mobs, new items or anything like that.
    
===========

Code to be taken a look at in the future:
* Client:
  - See if it is possible to optimize the code for rendering itemframes to make them produce less lagg.
* Server:
  - See if it is possible to optimize the mob pathfinding. (Especially zombies, since they tend to cause a lot of server problems)
